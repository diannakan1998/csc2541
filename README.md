##Time Series Analysis of Biomarkers For Multiple Myeloma

For multiple myeloma patients, a variety of lab test results are tracked and checked by doctors throughout the treatment process. These lab values serve as biomarkers for patients' responses to treatments. Using the longitudinal lab data, we build both auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model and hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict patients' future lab values. To better utilize patients' baseline and treatment data, we propose changes to the basic ARMA model to account for other external variables. Our results show that this newly proposed model outperforms both ARMA and HMM in predicting future lab value. We hope the predicted future lab values can assist doctors during the treatment process and serve as a reference for doctors to see the potential treatment outcomes.
